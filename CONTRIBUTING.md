I would love for the community to help me make `quantum_leap` the time mocking
gem we've collectively always wanted!

## Code

This is a **Ruby 1.9** gem meant to support **MRI**, **Rubinius** and
**JRuby**.

Changes to `quantum_leap` should not break on any of the supported Ruby
implementations. [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/#!/mattonrails/quantum_leap)
indicates the current build status on all three rubies.

QuantumLeap comes with a `MiniTest::Spec` test suite--the test framework built
into Ruby 1.9, with a little extra sugar.
